# Machine Learning by Dr.Brian Ziebart



### Introduction

The data is from one competetion posted on [kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/wendykan/lending-club-loan-data). Lending Club is the current leading peer to peer online loan platform market share wise. Our research goal is to answer this question with a simple Y/N to a new borrower given information. Since a loan default will cause both principal and uncollected interests losses, we want to prioritize on an as high as possible default case recall rate, also consider default case F-score and overall accuracy. 

The project is done in R. All results could be found in the slides, some more details contained in the presentation notes.
